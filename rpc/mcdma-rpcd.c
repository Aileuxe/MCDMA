/* mcdma-rpcd: request/reply transport between applications on two machines over MCDMA RDMA.
 *
 * Applications never open a verbs context. Each talks to its local daemon through a shared-memory mailbox, and
 * only the daemons hold queue pairs, so an application that crashes or is killed cannot leave a QP behind. One
 * source builds on Linux (libibverbs) and macOS (Apple's librdma, with MCDMA's CX5 provider or Thunderbolt RDMA).
 *
 *   mcdma-rpcd listen [--owner USER] NAME DEVICE GID_INDEX PATH_MTU VIA:PORT [REQ_MIB REP_MIB]
 *       One end of one link. Mailbox /dev/shm/mcdma-rpc.NAME on Linux, POSIX shared memory /mcdma-rpc.NAME on a
 *       Mac. The setup exchange listens on UDP PORT of the Thunderbolt IP interface VIA and admits only link-local
 *       datagrams that arrive there with hop limit 255, so only the machine at the other end of that cable gets in;
 *       VIA = IFACE/fe80::ADDR admits only that address. The Unix socket /tmp/mcdma-rpcd.NAME.sock takes one service
 *       ("MODE poll") and answers STATUS and SHUTDOWN. Started as root on Linux, --owner gives the mailbox and socket
 *       to USER, whose services then attach without root.
 *   mcdma-rpcd connect PEER...
 *       PEER = name,via,port,device,gid_index,path_mtu[,req_mib,rep_mib]
 *       e.g. worker-a,en2,18620,rdma_en2,1,4096,4,64
 *       One POSIX shared memory mailbox /mcdma-rpc.NAME and one thread per peer; each finds its listen end by
 *       multicast on VIA (or at VIA's pinned address) and offers from an ephemeral port to PORT. The Unix socket
 *       /tmp/mcdma-rpcd.sock answers STATUS and SHUTDOWN (tears every verbs object down, then exits).
 *   mcdma-rpcd version
 *
 * There is no TCP anywhere: the exchange is a few hundred bytes of IPv6 link-local datagrams on the Thunderbolt
 * cable, and every payload byte moves by RDMA. MCDMA_RPCD_SOCKET replaces the Unix socket path. Mailboxes and
 * sockets are owner-only: run the daemon as the user whose applications use it. NAME is 1-20 characters of
 * [A-Za-z0-9_-]. docs/link-daemon.md describes the mailbox (protocol 1), the exchange and both link kinds.
 *
 * Safety. The connect end takes its queue pairs past INIT only after the listen end has answered from RTS, posts
 * nothing before its own RTS, gives up on a peer by destroying its queue pairs inside a live process (never by
 * exiting), waits out or flushes every posted work request before destroying anything, and tears every object down
 * on every exit path. Every wait is bounded, so shutdown never hangs on a silent peer. One daemon serves each link
 * name: a lock file in /tmp is taken before any device or mailbox is touched, and a second daemon refuses to start.
 * SHUTDOWN, SIGINT and SIGTERM all stop it the same orderly way; SIGHUP is ignored, and SIGKILL, which skips the
 * teardown, must never be used.
